# Jacob Fu

💔 ChatGPT wrapper here. ChatGPT wrapper there.  
At this point, just make your personal website a ChatGPT wrapper.

So I did. Threw in my resume and a few quirks into the system prompt — and boom, it’s me.

Now recruiters don’t just read about Jacob.  
They **talk** to Jacob.

Ask me stuff like:

- “What kind of stuff have you worked on?” 🚀  
- “What’s your favourite colour?” 😁  
- “How cracked are you at Valorant?” 🤤  
- “Do you touch grass?” 🙈  
- “How many hours of TikTok do you watch a day?” 💀
